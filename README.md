 Etch-a-Sketch 
 A Vanilla JavaScript Project Demonstrating DOM Element Manipulation

Description: This project is a simple implementation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch game using vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates my ability to manipulate DOM elements dynamically, creating interactive and engaging web experiences.

Using JavaScript, I implemented functionality to allow users to draw on the virtual canvas using their mouse, change the grid size, and clear the canvas to start a new drawing. The user interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to get started with the game.

Functionalities:


1.Draw on the canvas: The user can use their mouse to draw on the virtual canvas. As they move their mouse over the canvas, the brush color is applied to the pixels, creating a drawing.

2.Change brush color: The user can choose from a selection of brush colors to use in their drawing. Clicking on a color swatch updates the brush color to the selected color.

3.Change brush width: The user can adjust the width of the brush stroke using a slider control. Moving the slider changes the brush width, allowing the user to create thicker or thinner lines.

4.Clear the canvas: The user can clear the canvas at any time by clicking on a "clear" button. This removes all of the pixels from the canvas, creating a blank slate for the user to start drawing on again.

5.Change grid size: The user can change the size of the drawing grid using a slider control. This updates the size of the canvas, allowing the user to create larger or smaller drawings.

6.Erase drawing: The user can erase part of their drawing using an eraser tool. Clicking on the eraser tool changes the brush color to white, allowing the user to "erase" parts of their drawing.

7.Save and load drawings: The user can save their drawings to a local storage, and load them later to continue editing. This allows the user to keep their progress and return to the drawing at a later time.
